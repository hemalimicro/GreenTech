### Introduction
Water is the most valuable natural resource since it is required for human survival and the continuation of life on the planet. Water scarcity refers to a shortage of freshwater supplies to meet demand. It manifests itself in the form of partial or non-fulfillment of indicated demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, user disputes, irreversible groundwater depletion, and negative environmental repercussions.
For at least one month of the year, one-third of the world's population (2 billion people) lives in acute water scarcity. 

Every year, half a billion people around the world are affected by severe water scarcity.
Water scarcity has affected half of the world's major cities.
Every day, each human consumes more than 90 gallons of water. In India, thousands of wells, borewells, and ponds have dried up. Every year, more than 3 to 4 million people die as a result of drinking filthy water. Less than 1% of the world's water is fit for human use, and that number is shrinking by the day.
Moreover, more than a hundred million people migrate as a result of drought and flooding.

#### The Effect of Water Scarcity

1. Lack of Access to Drinking Water: Water is needed for our everyday consumption and with little or no availability of water, access to clean and healthy water is not possible, which brings about starvation in the society.

3. Hunger: Water plays a vital role in our food consumption and intake of water is healthy for the body and water scarcity can bring out famine and hunger in the society,which leads to malnourishment of everyone.

5. Lack of Education: Water is neccessary for children to use to bath and get ready for school, wash their uniforms and drink when thirsty.

7. Poverty: Without Water, the industries such as manufacturing, production, transportation, healthcare etc can not function which in return reduces the productivity and GDP of the society and this leads to poverty. 

9. Sanitation: Water is needed to tidy and clean up our household and environment, when there is no water, everywhere becomes dirty, which is unhealthy and can bring about sickness.

9. Migration : This becomes the norm in a society with water scarcity, where families migrate to places where they can have full access to water. Migration brings about undevelopment in that particular society.

11. Conflict: With no availability of water, there is struggle in the society for the little or less water remaining, which leads to quarrel, fights and conflict between neigbors,communities and society at large.

12. Wildlife: It is not only humans that needs water, animals do too. Every year animals dies as a result of starvation from water, which can lead to extinction and affect the ecosystem. 

13. Agriculture: Water is a major constituent of photosynthesis and plants and crops need water to grow. lack of water leads to poor harvest, famine and pest invasion which is a huge lose to the farmer and society as well.
