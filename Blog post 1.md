### Introduction
Water is the most valuable natural resource since it is required for human survival and the continuation of life on the planet. Water scarcity refers to a shortage of freshwater supplies to meet demand. It manifests itself in the form of partial or non-fulfillment of indicated demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, user disputes, irreversible groundwater depletion, and negative environmental repercussions.
For at least one month of the year, one-third of the world's population (2 billion people) lives in acute water scarcity. 

Every year, half a billion people around the world are affected by severe water scarcity.
Water scarcity has affected half of the world's major cities.
Every day, each human consumes more than 90 gallons of water. In India, thousands of wells, borewells, and ponds have dried up. Every year, more than 3 to 4 million people die as a result of drinking filthy water. Less than 1% of the world's water is fit for human use, and that number is shrinking by the day.
Moreover, more than a hundred million people migrate as a result of drought and flooding.

#### The Effect of Water Scarcity

1. Lack of Access to Drinking Water: Water is needed for our everyday consumption and with little or no availability of water, access to clean and healthy water is not possible, which brings about starvation in the society.

3. Hunger: Hunger is one of the most serious effect of water scarcity. Water plays a vital role in our food production through crop and livestock farming, when there is shortage in production, it can lead to famine and hunger in the society. Intake of water is healthy for the body and when not taken in the right consumption and amount can lead to malnourishment.

5. Lack of Education: Water scarcity makes it difficult for children to go to school because they need water to bath and get ready for school, wash their uniforms and drink when thirsty and when this is not available, they travel long distance in search for water.

7. Poverty: Without Water, the industries such as manufacturing, production, transportation, healthcare etc can not function which in return reduces the productivity and GDP of the society and this affect families living in that area because they can't afford the bare minimum and have access to resources. 

9. Sanitation: Lack of water can cause alot of disease, because people tend to drink and store unclean water, to avoid starvation.  Water is needed to tidy and clean up our household and environment, cooking and bathing. when there is shortage of water, sanitation becomes a problem and the environment becomes unhygienic for human living.

9. Migration : This becomes the norm in a society with water scarcity, where families migrate to places where they can have access to water. Migration brings about undevelopment in that particular society.

11. Conflict: With no availability of water, there is struggle in the society for the little or less water remaining, which leads to quarrel, fights and destruction of properties between neigbors and communities.

12. Wildlife: It is not only humans that needs water, animals do too. Every year animals dies as a result of starvation from water, which can lead to extinction and affect the ecosystem. 

13. Agriculture: Water is a major constituent of photosynthesis and plants and crops need water to grow. lack of water leads to poor harvest, famine and pest invasion which is a huge lose to the farmer and society as well.

14. Loss of Biodiversity: Severe water shortage in a region can lead to some animals becoming extinct since they can starve or die of thirst. Many plants may no longer be able to grow and reproduce in a sufficient manner causing serious biodiversity loss.
