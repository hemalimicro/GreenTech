### What is Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science engineering where we try to make machines act wisely just like human beings. Artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that impersonate human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the data they collect. It is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is a system that combines computer science and Robust Data for problem-solving.

## Types of Artificial Intelligence
# Type-1 AI:
1.Weak AI or Narrow AI
2.General AI
3.Super AI
# Type-2 AI:
1.Reactive Machines
2.Limited Memory
3.Theory of Mind
4.Self Awareness

### Using AI to solve Water Scarcity

Water Scarcity can be solved using Artifical Intelligent. One of the ways to solve this problem is using data. Instead of humans trying to figure out with their spreadsheets how do we know route and plan this whole thing we can use data analytics to optimally schedule everything more efficient it's much faster and they're just way more comfortable.

Steps involved:

1) Install Water Meters that connects to Internet.
2) Collect Data
3) Take Actions

With the help of Water Meters we can track the flow of water, Over use, and many other things. Water Meters collect the data and send the it to the cloud. The data will be continuosly analyzed and monitored by the algorithms and then take real-time decisions like Alerting the user or authority, Restricting water flow and Informing leakage to government. With the help of data we can predict the forecast demand. In agriculture we can use water efficiently and save water.
