## What is Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science engineering where we try to make machines act wisely just like human beings. Artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that impersonate human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the data they collect. It is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is a system that combines computer science and Robust Data for problem-solving.

By using AI we can transform old traditional taps and water tankers to smart ones. The data which can be collected using AI can be very useful in predicting various things depending on the patterns that is generated through data.
AI can be combined with various technologies like IOT and Machine Learning to make it work more efficiently.



### Using AI to solve Water Scarcity

Water Scarcity can be solved using Artifical Intelligence. The reason behind choosing AI is that it can yield us a set of data and also various patterns out of those data.
One of the ways to solve this problem is using data. Instead of humans trying to figure out with their spreadsheets how do we know route and plan this whole thing we can use data analytics to optimally schedule everything more efficiently and it's much faster, making it way more comfortable.

#### Steps involved:

1) Install Water Meters that connects to Internet.
2) Collect Data
3) Take Actions

#### Install Water Meters
 
By installing water meters which are Internet based, we can track the flow of water. More wastage of water is due to not knowing the flow of water. Not being aware of flow of water can generally lead to over usage of water. When these water meters are installed in water taps,faucets and spigots they collect all the data of water usage.The data which is collected is next being processed through next steps.

#### Collect Data

Once the data is being collected, it is sent to the cloud(Azure Services). We have different algorithms ready for analyzing the data. As soon as these data is sent to the cloud,it is continuously analyzed and monitored by the algorithms. Based on the results there are Real-time decisions taken in further steps.

#### Take Actions
 
When the data is processed through prvious steps, it finally reaches the last phase. In this phase the algorithms used provides a conclusion, basing on which actions are taken. It can be Alerting the user or authority, Restricting water flow and informing leakage to government.This can help in reducing all the domestic water consumption. It can also be implemented in industries. With the help of data we can predict the forecast demand. Apart from industries this technique can also be used in agriculture to use water efficiently and save water.
