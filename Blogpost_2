Water Scarcity can be solved using Artifical Intelligent. One of the ways to solve this problem is using data. Instead of humans trying to figure out with their spreadsheets how do we know route and plan this whole thing we can use data analytics to optimally schedule everything more efficient it's much faster and they're just way more comfortable.

Steps involved:

1) Install Water Meters that connects to Internet.
2) Collect Data
3) Take Actions

With the help of Water Meters we can track the flow of water, Over use, and many other things. Water Meters collect the data and send the it to the cloud. The data will be continuosly analyzed and monitored by the algorithms and then take real-time decisions like Alerting the user or authority, Restricting water flow and Informing leakage to government. With the help of data we can predict the forecast demand. In agriculture we can use water efficiently and save water.
