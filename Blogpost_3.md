While finding out solution for reducing water scarcity we have come across some of the real time problems that were actually solved using Artificial Intelligence.
Not only one country but there are several other countries which have been using AI for reducing the consumption of water and using water efficiently.
One of such cases was The European Research project NAIADES. It aims to minimize costs for water utilities by developing, implementing, and integrating several innovative tools into the water ecosystem. Specifically, NAIADES introduces artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the water ecosystem, leaving the management of this precious resource to robots. The Dunărea Brăila Public Utilities Company (CUP Dunărea Brăila) works in partnership with the software company SIMAVI to digitize the drinking water distribution network in the Radu Negru neighborhood.

SIMAVI offers this pilot hardware and software support for:

-Collecting all the measurements from the water distribution network (pressure sensors, noise sensors, flow sensors)
Modeling them and sending them to the cloud to AI services to generate highly accurate predictions. Thus, the specialists from CUP Dunărea Brăila can collect and analyze, in a unitary way and on a single platform, all the data collected from the sensor system in the water network, historical information, and real-time, as well as statistics and predictions based on historical measurements.

-Reducing water leakage in the network, providing support for the integration of hydraulic models in combination with in situ and AI measurements.
At the same time, SIMAVI provides weather data for the city of Brăila, to help calculate water consumption in certain sectors.

SIMAVI has extensive experience in projects developed for European Union organizations, the European Commission, and the Council of Europe. Its team of specialists has been involved in European projects for more than ten years.
